* Introduction
** Prelude

  subsections of this presentation
- The articles in the "Resources" section are clickable hyperlinks

  navigation
* Problem
** Inescapable Vulnerabilities of Computer Systems
- Computer systems and networks thereof are vulnerable to unauthorized
  access and malicious activity. This vulnerability cannot be fully
  mitigated because computer systems are used and maintained by
  humans, which by their nature are fallible.

- System and network administrators must implement accounting
  techniques which record possible violations for further review.

\note{IDSs fill the gap that exists between the preventative safety
measures that administrators setup to protect their systems against
known attacks, and attacks that are nevertheless successfull. An IDS
is like a security camera in a bank vault: if the system was perfect
they would be superfluous, but with the admission that there will be
faults in a system's security, the IDS records what policy violations,
which may catch possible intrusion attempts, in addition to any damage
that may have been done, so that the violations can be reviewed, the
damage can be addressed, and administrators can put into effect
regressive security measures.}

* Potential Solutions
* Proposed Solution
** Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for System and Network Accountability
- An IDS is a set of techniques using a combination of software,
  hardware, and administrative policies in order to monitor a computer
  system or network of systems for policy violations, unauthorized
  access, or malicious activity.

- This monitoring is perodically transformed into a report for further
  review by the system's administrators.

\note{Note that an IDS cannot by itself see the difference between an
innocent and malicious policy violation, so in actuality all it does
is record policy violations. These policy violations may or may not
correspond to an attack. An IDS is necessitated because most computer
security issues are caused by insiders; that is, users who
purposefully have significant privleges within a system (in order to
do their work), which would obviously not be blocked by a
firewall. The majority of harm these insiders do is unintentional, yet
are still recorded as policy violations [Pfleeger s7.5]. It is up to
the system administrators' periodic review of the IDS reports to sift
through the recorded violations and determine which were malicious,
which were honest mistakes, and which were false alarms.}

** Signature-based IDS
This type of IDS checks packets traveling across a network against a
known set of patterns recognized as likely attacks.

\note{This is similar to a virus scanner checking files against a
database of known malicious code signatures. Types of "attacks" caught
by this system include: port scans, malformed packets (illegal TCP
flag combinations, wrong sizes, etc.), connection attempts from
reserved IP addresses (indicating the real source was masked), e-mail
containing viruses, exploit shellcode sequences in packets (Domain
Name Service / Network Interface Card buffer overflow), flood of
packets (Denial Of Service), etc. [Frederick]. The major problem is
that attackers are well-aware of this type of checking, and can
(easily) alter their attack in such a way as to change its
signature. This requires a SBIDS to maintain a frequently updated
database, and slows down the IDS's ability to check against said
database as its size grows. An SBIDS is also useless against new
(zero-day) exploits.}

** Statistical anomaly-based IDS
This type of IDS alerts when an abnormal event takes place on a
network, such as a spike of traffic to a particular server or region.

\note{Also known as heuristic IDS. These generally compare current
activity against a known safe "baseline", which is a set of patterns
of normal activity for a certain system. This can lead to many false
positives, but can also catch attacks that would otherwise not be
recorded by an SBIDS. This type of system uses an "inference engine",
which follow two patterns: state-based, where the IDS attempts to
detect when the system has entered an unsafe state; and model-based,
where the IDS maps current activity onto a model of unacceptable
activity, and alarms when they match [Pfleeger s7.5].}

  - "Snort's open source network-based intrusion detection system
    (NIDS) has the ability to perform real-time traffic analysis and
    packet logging on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Snort performs
    protocol analysis, content searching, and content matching."

  - "Prelude collects, normalizes, sorts, aggregates, correlates and
    reports all security-related events independently of the product
    brand or license giving rise to such events."

* Summary
** Summary
The intent of an IDS is to produce a report for
administrators of detected policy violations, which may or may not
indicate that an intrusion took place. An IDS represents a passive
methodology, which is in contrast to an Intrusion Prevention
System. The latter attempts to be reactive, by for example, blocking a
detected intruder's IP address from connecting).

* Questions
** What is an Intrusion Detection System?
Refer to proposed solution
** Why do we need Intrusion Detection Systems?
Refer to problem
** What are the two types of IDS monitoring?
*** Signature-based IDS
*** Statistical anomaly-based IDS
** Where do IDSs fall short?
1. Does not react to attacks
2. Very high rate of false-alarms leads to high noise making the detection of legimate intrusions more difficult
3. Intruders could hide by editing the IDS logs
4. Etc.
** What is the reactive counterpart to IDS?
An Intrusion Prevention System is the reactive complement to an IDS.
