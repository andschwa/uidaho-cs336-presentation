* Introduction
** Prelude
- Our "Overview" is the "Outline" page, which is clickable to the
  subsections of this presentation
- The articles in the "Resources" section are clickable hyperlinks
- The buttons at the bottom-right corner of the page can be used for
  navigation
* Problem
** Inescapable Vulnerabilities of Computer Systems
- Computer systems and networks thereof are vulnerable to unauthorized
  access and malicious activity. This vulnerability cannot be fully
  mitigated because computer systems are used and maintained by
  humans, which by their nature are fallible.

- System and network administrators must implement accounting
  techniques which record possible violations for further review.

\note{Sample notes}

* Potential Solutions
* Proposed Solution
** Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for System and Network Accountability
- An IDS is a set of techniques using a combination of software,
  hardware, and administrative policies in order to monitor a computer
  system or network of systems for unauthorized access or malicious
  activity.

- This monitoring is perodically transformed into a report for further
  review by the system's administrators.

** Signature-based IDS
This type of IDS checks packets traveling across a network against a
known set of patterns recognized as likely attacks.

** Statistical anomaly-based IDS
This type of IDS alerts when an abnormal event takes place on a
network, such as a spike of traffic to a particular server or region.

** Free IDS Tools (and detail about how they work)

- [[http://www.snort.org][Snort]]

  - "Snort's open source network-based intrusion detection system
    (NIDS) has the ability to perform real-time traffic analysis and
    packet logging on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Snort performs
    protocol analysis, content searching, and content matching."

- [[http://aide.sourceforge.net][AIDE]]

  - "AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) is a file and
    directory integrity checker."

- [[https://www.prelude-ids.org][Prelude-IDS]]

  - "Prelude collects, normalizes, sorts, aggregates, correlates and
    reports all security-related events independently of the product
    brand or license giving rise to such events."

* Summary
** Summary
The intent of an IDS is to produce a report for
administrators of detected policy violations, which may or may not
indicate that an intrusion took place. An IDS represents a passive
methodology, which is in contrast to an Intrusion Prevention
System. The latter attempts to be reactive, by for example, blocking a
detected intruder's IP address from connecting).

* Questions
** What is an Intrusion Detection System?
Refer to proposed solution
** Why do we need Intrusion Detection Systems?
Refer to problem
** What are the two types of IDS monitoring?
*** Signature-based IDS
*** Statistical anomaly-based IDS
** Where do IDSs fall short?
1. Does not react to attacks
2. Very high rate of false-alarms leads to high noise making the detection of legimate intrusions more difficult
3. Intruders could hide by editing the IDS logs
4. Etc.
** What is the reactive counterpart to IDS?
An Intrusion Prevention System is the reactive complement to an IDS.
